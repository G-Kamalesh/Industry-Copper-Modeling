# Industry-Copper-Modeling
Creating Regression and Classification Model for Predicting Selling Price and Status

# Introduction
The Industrial Copper Modeling project focuses on predicting the selling price and status (won or lost) in the industrial copper market using machine learning regression and classification algorithms. By exploring the dataset, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, and applying various machine learning techniques, we aim to develop models that can accurately predict the selling price and status in the copper market.
# Requirements
To run this project, the following libraries are needed:
* NumPy: A library for numerical computations in Python.
* Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
* Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides various regression and classification algorithms.
* Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations.
* Seaborn: A data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.
Make sure these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the project.
